    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Michael Jordan life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1963</strong> - Born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, USA</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1963</strong> - Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 
        New York City, on February 17, 1963, the son of bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) 
        and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.
    </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1977</strong> - Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, 
        where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football.
         He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year; at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m),
          he was deemed too short to play at that level. 
        His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1981</strong> - As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, 
        Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting 
        (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship 
        game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft 
        after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary
         reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1987</strong> -Jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season,
         averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also
          named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg) and a league-high 
          3.1 steals per game (spg).The Bulls finished 50–32,and made it out of the first round of the
           playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1991</strong> -In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg
         on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season. The Bulls finished in first place
          in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the 
          regular season.
          
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1993</strong> - On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement,
         saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder 
         of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1995</strong> - The Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup,
        and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.
        The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. 
        Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one 
        point in mid-March;the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.

        In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a
         replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.On March 18, 1995,
          Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: 
          "I'm back."The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face 
          the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points. The game had the highest 
          Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - With Phil Jackson's contract expiring, 
        the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and
         being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players,
          Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.On January 19, 2000,
           Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of 
           basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.Jordan's responsibilities 
           with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' 
           basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of 
           Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong> - On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return 
        to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate 
        his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.
        In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg),
         and steals (1.4 spg), and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and
          playoff contention;he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot and subsequently announce his retirement</li>
